            It was an introductory course to frontend development, where I
            worked on projects using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. I
            graduated in 2 months with a final integrated project using
            Bootstrap as an additional technology.

            I am currently taking the last subjects of the degree, where along
            this journey I developed applications with C#, learning the
            fundamentals of programming in general with this language. I worked
            with SQL Server to create Windows Forms applications related to
            business management. Additionally, we worked with React for web
            application development with ASP as the backend tool. I am expected
            to graduate by the end of 2024.
