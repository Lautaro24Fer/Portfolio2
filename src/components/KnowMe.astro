  <p class="text-lg flex">
    Hello! my name is Lautaro Fernandez, i'm 21 and I am full-stack developer. I
    currently studying at UTN FRSN in Argentina, pursuing a degree in Superior
    Technician in Programming. For the past 3 years, I have been dedicated to
    creating web applications, and constantly seeking new knowledge and a place
    to apply itðŸ˜€
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg">
    Since I was born, I've been very close to a computer, a cell phone, or a
    video game console. Computing quickly became something very important and
    fascinating in my life, and the desire to learn how things work has never
    ended for me. Since I started high school, I've been studying computer
    science, graduated, and I am constantly developing myself as a professional
    to give my best wherever I may beðŸ‘¾
